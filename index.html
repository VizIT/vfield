        <!--<p>
          Progress in mathematics, physics or engineering at the college level requires a strong
         understanding of mathematics.
        </p>-->

          VField produces powerful interactive visualizations of vector fields, including
          electric fields, from simple configurations.  Or use the API directly for more
          sophisticated presentations and better performance.  These visualizations and their
          interactions are designed to integrate seamlessly with your content and not pull the
          student out of the flow your presentation. This contrasts sharply with most other
          interactive toolkits that provide self contained pieces, interactives, that may not
          match the content or style of your presentation, and fail to provide integrated
          interactivity with the content as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of these visualizations are built directly from configurations that describe 
          a physical charge arrangement, or that describe a mathematical function. They
          provide the standard swipe to rotate and mouse wheel or pinch to zoom.
        </p>

        <p> 
          The following pages describe how to build several examples and how to add
          additional interactivity. For the first example we draw vectors for the electric
          field around a point charge.
        </p>

        <figure class="center">
          <!--This is the canvas for our electric field visualization. -->
          <canvas id="chargeCanvas" width="300" height="300"></canvas>
          <figcaption>The electric field from a point charge represented
                      as a vector field.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We produce this with three simple steps.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Include VField on your page.</li>
          <li>Configure the visualization.</li>
          <li>Give a place to draw the visualization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Include VField</h3>

          <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-js">
&lt;script defer src="http://vizit.github.io/vfield/js/VField.min.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
          </code></pre>

          <p>
            The <samp>script</samp> tag includes VField on your page. The
            <samp>defer</samp> attribute loads the script asynchronously, and
            preserves order when multiple scripts are loaded. This will be
            important later.
          </p>
          <p>
            VField is an open source project hosted on <a href
            = "https://github.com/VizIT/vfield">github</a>. Feel free to
            examine the source, clone the repository, or make feature requests
            by creating an issue. And please help everyone out by raising any
            problems you have as an issue.
          </p>

          <h3>Configure the visualization</h3>
            <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-js">
&lt;script&gt;
  // This object is loaded by the VizBuilder on the DOMReady event.
  var VISUALIZATION_CONFIG
      = {
          // This is a simple vector field, so we draw
          // vectors representing the field along the field lines.
          type:      "simple vector field",
          // The id of the canvas we draw into
          canvas:    "chargeCanvas",
          scale:     5.0,
          arrowSize: 1.0,
          // f is a vector valued function.
          // In this case the electric field from a single charge.
          f:  {
                type: "charge",  charge:  5.0,
                x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0,
                nfieldLines: 25.0
              }
        };
&lt;/script&gt;
            </code></pre>

            <p>
              <code>VISUALIZATION_CONFIG</code> holds the visualization configuration
              as a JavaScript object. This configuration starts out with some general
              properties of the visualization, then sets up the vector field.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>type</code> property defines, as you might expect, the type of graph
              that is drawn. A <samp>simple vector field</samp> traces field lines and
              draws vectors at several points along the field lines.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>canvas</code> is the id of the canvas we will draw on. In this case,
              <samp>chargeCanvas</samp>. As with any HTML id, it must be unique on the page.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>scale</code> controls how much of the graph is drawn on the screen. A
              scale of 1.0 means that the region where x, y and z each vary from  -1.0 to +1.0
              is drawn to the screen, or a scale of 50 means that the region where x, y, and
              z range from -50 to +50 is drawn to the screen. This can also be thought of as
              zooming in with smaller numbers, and zooming out with larger numbers. Of course
              the user can always zoom in and out manually, the scale is just the initial zoom.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>arrowSize</code> controls the size of the arrows as drawn on the screen.
              Specifically it is the scale of the vector field units to the spatial units drawn
              on the screen.
            </p>

            <p>
              The vector field is defined by a vector valued function, <code>f</code>. In this example,
              <code>f</code> is the electric field from a point charge at the origin.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <code>type</code> of <code>f</code> is <samp>charge</samp>, which corresponds to a
              point charge, whose electric field is used as the vector valued function.
            </p>

            <p>
              The magnitude of the charge is given by <code>charge</code>. The charge units are
              <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcoulomb">statC</a>. However, we draw
              no axes, and allow you to control the size of the vectors, so you could consider
              the charge to be any units you choose. The actual units are only clear on examination
              of the code.
            </p>

            <p>
              The position of the charge is pretty straightforward. There is a property for each
              coordinate <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>. The units are treated
              as cm in the code, but as with the charge you can chose any that are consistent with
              your content. In this case, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> are
              all <samp>0.0</samp>.
            </p>

            <p>
              We mentioned earlier that the simple vector field traces field lines and draws
              field vectors spaced out along the field lines. The number of field lines traced
              is controlled by the <code>nfieldLines</code> property. Changes in the magnitude
              of the field produce proportional changes in the size of the vectors.
            </p>

          <h3>Give a place to draw</h3>

          <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-html">
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
  &lt;!--This is the canvas for our visualization. --&gt;
  &lt;canvas id="chargeCanvas" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The electric field from a point charge represented
              as a vector field.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
          </code></pre>

          <p>
            The canvas with an id matching the canvas id given in the visualization
            configuration is the only requirement. Wrapping it with a figure element
            gives a more polished appearance for the visualization and the caption.
          </p>

          <p>
           These are exactly the steps used to create the example at the top of the page,
           as I encourage you to verify with <samp>view source</samp>.
           They can be included in any order on any web page to produce the same result.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an alternative, we can display the field lines. This uses a different type
            of graph, which we show <a href = "pointChargeField.html">next</a>.
