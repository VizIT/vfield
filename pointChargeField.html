        <h1>Field Lines From a Point Charge</h1>
        <p id="nowebgl" class="error"></p>

        <p>
          Field lines are another common way of visualizing vector fields,
         especially electric fields.  This time we show the field lines emanating
         from the same positive charge as the first example. We also draw the
         charge itself, as is traditional with this representation of the field.
        </p>

        <p>
          To produce a graph of field lines we use a different type of graph,
          <samp>electric field</samp>, which is particularly built for electrostatics
          problems. The <samp>electric field</samp> graph has slightly different,
          but very similar, properties from the <samp>simple vector field</samp>.
        </p>

        <figure class="center">
          <!--This is the canvas for our electric field visualization. -->
          <canvas id="chargeCanvas" width="300" height="300"></canvas>
          <figcaption>The electric field from a point charge represented
                      as a set of field lines.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We follow the same steps as the first example.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Include VField on your page.</li>
          <li>Configure the visualization.</li>
          <li>Give a place to draw the visualization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Include VField</h3>
        <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-js">
&lt;script defer src=http://vizit.github.io/vfield/js/VField.min.js&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          We use slightly different features from the VField package, so the script
          tag is the same. Remember that VField is an <a href
          = "https://github.com/VizIT/vfield">open source project</a> and that we
          encourage your feedback, especially if you encounter trouble or problems.
          Help us help you, leave a comment or open an issue.
        </p>


          <h3>Configure the visualization</h3>
         <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-js">
&lt;script&gt;
  // This object is loaded by the VizBuilder on the DOMReady event.
  var VISUALIZATION_CONFIG
      = {
          // The electric field graph displays charges,
          // field lines and gaussian surfaces.
          type:          "electric field",
          // The id of the canvas we draw into
          canvas:        "chargeCanvas",
          scale:         50.0,
          arrowHeadSize: 1.0,
          arrowSpacing:  15,
          // Position a single charge at the origin
          elements:
            {
              type: "charge",  charge:  5.0,
              x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0,
              fieldLineDensity: 5.0
            }
        };
&lt;/script&gt;
         </code></pre>

         <p>
           The configuration, though, is different. This visualization is
           an <samp>electric field</samp> diagram. <samp>Electric field</samp>
           diagrams draw the charges and the resulting field lines.
         </p>

         <p>
           We reuse the the <code>canvas</code> id since we are on a new page. 
           It is the same figure & canvas setup, we simply changed the figure caption.
         </p>

         <p>
           The scale controls the region that is drawn to the screen. Here, the scale
           is <samp>50</samp> so we draw the region where <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>
           and <code>z</code> each range from <samp>-50</samp> to <samp>+50</samp>.
           VField uses orthographic projection in case you are curious, this means we do
           not generate any perspective.
         </p>

         <p>
           The <code>arrowHeadSize</code> directly controls the size of the arrowheads,
           or directional indicators, on the field lines. There is no association between
           the arrowhead size and the field strength. Choose the arrowhead size so the
           arrowheads are clearly visible at the intended scale.
         </p>

         <p>
           The <code>arrowSpacing</code> directly controls the spacing between the
           direction indicators. Choose a smaller spacing for field lines with a strong
           curvature, and a large spacing for straighter field lines such as those for
           a point charge or charged plane.
         </p>

         <p>
           The <code>elements</code> are the charge configuration that generates the
           electric field, or surfaces that illustrate things about the field. Further
           examples will show different configurations including multiple charges,
           charged planes, charged spheres, charged cylinders, and charged lines and
           Gaussian surfaces.
         </p>

         <p>
           This example contains a single element of <code>type</code> <samp>charge</samp>,
           which corresponds to a point charge, whose electric we draw. All of the charges
           from the <samp>electric field</samp> can also be used in the <samp>simple vector
           field</samp>. The simple vector field also allows vector valued functions to be
           used.
         </p>

         <p>
           The magnitude of the charge is given by <code>charge</code>. The charge units are
           <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcoulomb">statC</a>. However, we draw
           no axes, and allow you to control the size of the vectors, so you could consider
           the charge to be any units you choose. The actual units are only clear on examination
           of the code.
         </p>

         <p>
           The position of the charge is pretty straightforward. There is a property for each
           coordinate <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>. The units are treated
           as cm in the code, but as with the charge you can chose any that are consistent with
           your content. In this case, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> are all
           <samp>0.0</samp> so the units are unlikely to gain any notice.
         </p>

         <p>
           An interesting difference is the use of <code>fieldLineDensity</code> to determine
           the number of field lines that are drawn. VField uses the <code>fieldLineDensity</code>
           and the <code>charge</code> to determine the number of field lines to draw, so that
           the number of field lines is <code>fieldLineDensity * charge</code>.  This is because
           field line diagrams indicate the strength of the field by changing the number of field
           lines. Increasing the charge increases the number of field lines, while decreasing the
           charge decreases the number of field lines. A later example shows how to dynamically
           change the charge.
         </p>

         <h3>Give a place to draw</h3>

         <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-html">
&lt;figure class="center"&gt;
  &lt;!--This is the canvas for our visualization. --&gt;
  &lt;canvas id="chargeCanvas" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The electric field from a point charge represented
              as a set of field lines.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
         </code></pre>

         <p>
           The canvas with an id matching the canvas id given in the configuration
           is the only requirement. Wrapping it with a figure element gives a more
           polished appearance for the visualization and the caption.
         </p>

        <p>
          Once again this is exactly the markup used to generate the example on this
          page. Our next example shows how to put <a href = "sideBySide.html">multiple
          visualizations on a page</a>.
