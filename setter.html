        <h1>Setting values</h1>
        <p id="nowebgl" class="error"></p>

        <p>
          Setting specific values and scenarios is an essential element of instructional
          content. With applications ranging from setting initial conditions to running
          examples and illustrating specific points any toolkit is incomplete without it.
          Once again, the VField and Lesson libraries team up to build this by binding
          events to values and providing easy to use HTML elements to generate the events.
          So that, in this case, clicking on a button sets values in the visualization.
        </p>

        <p>
          We build an example that extends the Gaussian surface from last time. We add some
          additional bindings for the position of the charge, and also the existence
          of the spherical and a new cylindrical surface. Then we setup controls to set values
          for them and show how they can be used in instructional design.

        <p>
          We see all the electric field lines pass through the sphere. The field
          lines are outward bound for a
          <span class="lessonElement"
                data-type="setter"
                data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=0, q=5"
                data-html="positive charge"></span>,
          and inward bound for a 
          <span class="lessonElement"
                data-type="setter"
                data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=0, q=-5"
                data-html="negative charge"></span>.
            When the charge is at the
            <span class="lessonElement"
                  data-type="setter"
                  data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=0, z=0"
                  data-html="center"></span>
            of the sphere, the field lines are perpendicular, or normal, to the
            surface where they cross it. The field lines are also evenly distributed
            over the surface, which tells us that the electric field has a constant
            strength at any point on the sphere. If we move the charge to the
            <span class="lessonElement"
                  data-type="setter"
                  data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=10, y=0, r=20"
                  data-html="right"></span>,
            to the
            <span class="lessonElement"
                  data-type="setter"
                  data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=-10, y=0, r=20"
                  data-html="left" ></span>,
            if we move it 
            <span class="lessonElement"
                  data-type="setter"
                  data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=10, r=20"
                  data-html="up"></span>,
            or if we move it 
            <span class="lessonElement"
                  data-type="setter"
                  data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=-10, r=20"
                  data-html="down"></span>,
            as long as the charge remains within the surface the same fields lines
            cross the surface in the same direction. Where the field lines cross the
            surface changes, and the angle between the field lines and the surface
            changes, but the same field lines cross the surface no matter where the
            charge is within the surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            Take the charge
            <span class="lessonElement"
                  data-type="setter"
                  data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=25, r=20"
                  data-html="outside"></span>
             of the surface, and something completely different happens. Look carefully,
             when the charge is outside of the surface many of the field lines no longer
             cross the surface at all, and those that do cross the surface pass into and
             out of the surface. A charge outside of the surface makes no contribution
             to field lines passing through the surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we
            <span class="lessonElement"
                  data-type="setter"
                  data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=0, r=30"
                  data-html="increase"></span>
          the size of the surface we see that the fields lines are spread further apart
          where they cross the surface. This corresponds to a weaker field. So the electric
          field gets weaker the further away from the point charge we get. For a 
          <span class="lessonElement"
                data-type="setter"
                data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=0, r=10"
                data-html="smaller"></span>
          surface, we see the opposite effect. The field lines are closer together where
          they cross the surface, so the field is stronger closer to the point charge.
        </p>

        <p>
          If instead we
          <span class="lessonElement"
                data-type="setter"
                data-set="x=0, y=0, drawSphere=false, drawCylinder=true"
                data-html="draw a cylinder"></span>, we lose the nice features we
          we saw when we paired a sphere with a spherically symmetric field. The same
          field lines cross the surface in the same direction, but they intersect the
          surface at a wide variety of angles, and their density varies significantly
          across the surface.

          We will still follow the general pattern to build this visualization.
          However, we will have significantly more sophisticated configuration and
          interactions.

        <p>
          This time the elements contain a Gaussian cylinder as well
          as a Gaussian sphere. Of course it would be confusing to show
          them both at the same time, so we set their <samp>enabled</samp>
          property to show only one at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both the elements and some of the bindings are now arrays. Elements and
          bindings can be single items or arrays. Arrays are required to contain
          multiple entries. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The point charge at the origin is joined by a sphere, also centered
          at the origin.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>q</code> remains bound to the <code>charge</code>,
          and <code>r</code> is bound to the radius, <code>r</code>,
          of the sphere.
        </p>

        <p>
          Manipulating the charge shows that the number of field lines crossing
          the sphere changes in direct proportion to the change in the charge.
          Manipulating the radius of the sphere illustrates how the space between
          the field lines increases with r<sup>2</sup>.

          We know which lesson element they are from <code>data-type="setter"</code>.
          But, exactly what does a setter do?
        </p>

        <p>
          Data-set,
          <code>data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=0, q=-5"</code>
          is a list of variables and the values that are set when the generated button
          is activated. This is a list to ensure that the entire visualization is set
          to reflect your narrative. Separate varChanged events are generated for each
          assignment in the list. This is consistent with the design of Lesson and
          VField where value changes are signaled by events.
        </p>

        <table class="explanation">
          <tr>
            <th>attribute</th><th>meaning</th><th>example</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>class</td><td>Identifies a component of a lesson.</td><td><code>lessonElement</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>data-type</td><td>The type of component.</td><td><code>data-type="setter"</code></td>
          </tr>

            <td>data-set</td><td>List of variable=value assignments.</td><td><code>data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, <br />
                                                                             x=0, y=0, q=-5"</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>data-html</td><td>HTML content that is placed within the button.</td><td><code>data-html="negative charge"</code></td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          The next section of the example uses the setter to move the charge
          around and discuss the patterns of field lines crossing the surface.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-html">
When the charge is at the
&lt;span class="lessonElement"
      data-type="setter"
      data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=0, z=0"
      data-html="center"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
of the sphere, the field lines are perpendicular, or normal, to the
surface where they cross it. The field lines are also evenly distributed
over the surface, which tells us that the electric field has a constant
strength at any point on the sphere. If we move the charge to the
&lt;span class="lessonElement"
      data-type="setter"
      data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=10, y=0, r=20"
      data-html="right"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
to the
&lt;span class="lessonElement"
      data-type="setter"
      data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=-10, y=0, r=20"
      data-html="left" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
if we move it 
&lt;span class="lessonElement"
      data-type="setter"
      data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=10, r=20"
      data-html="up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
or if we move it 
&lt;span class="lessonElement"
      data-type="setter"
      data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=-10, r=20"
      data-html="down"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
as long as the charge remains within the surface the same fields lines
cross the surface in the same direction. Where the field lines cross the
surface changes, and the angle between the field lines and the surface
changes, but the same field lines cross the surface no matter where the
charge is within the surface.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Take the charge
&lt;span class="lessonElement"
      data-type="setter"
      data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=25, r=20"
      data-html="outside"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
of the surface, and something completely different happens. Look carefully,
when the charge is outside of the surface many of the field lines no longer
cross the surface at all, and those that do cross the surface pass into and
out of the surface. A charge outside of the surface makes no contribution
to field lines passing through the surface.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we
&lt;span class="lessonElement"
      data-type="setter"
      data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=0, r=30"
      data-html="increase"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

the size of the surface we see that the fields lines are spread further apart
where they cross the surface. This corresponds to a weaker field. So the electric
field gets weaker the further away from the point charge we get. For a 
&lt;span class="lessonElement"
      data-type="setter"
      data-set="drawSphere=true, drawCylinder=false, x=0, y=0, r=10"
      data-html="smaller"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
surface, we see the opposite effect. The field lines are closer together where
they cross the surface, so the field is stronger closer to the point charge.
&lt;/p&gt;
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          This last piece of the example we set <samp>drawSphere=false,
          drawCylinder=true</samp> to show the significance of matching
          the shape to inherent symmetries of the problem.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-html">
&lt;p&gt;
If instead we
&lt;span class="lessonElement"
      data-type="setter"
      data-set="x=0, y=0, drawSphere=false, drawCylinder=true"
      data-html="draw a cylinder"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, we lose the nice features we
we saw when we paired a sphere with a spherically symmetric field. The same
field lines cross the surface in the same direction, but they intersect the
surface at a wide variety of angles, and their density varies significantly
across the surface.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <p>
          This is perhaps a slightly rich example, but it shows the different types of
          interactions that are available with this simple mechanism to set parameters
          for a visualization. It demonstrates how far we can go in creating richer
          interactive content for clearer explanations and more effective teaching.

          Our next example is takes us in a different direction and show how to work
          directly with <a href="functions.html">vector fields</a>.
